# android10gmail_ui_flutter

A Flutter project from [Flutter's tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab).

It adds transparent bottom and top bar, on both iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

If for any reason this does not compile for you, just clone the main Flutter repository (master branch) from GitHub, instead of using the stable version.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
